USAGE GUIDE

# INFO
To check the purpose of the superpy tool and its available arguments use:
python super.py --help

To find more information about a specific argument (e.g. 'report') use:
python super.py report --help

# SET UP
To use the superpy tool, first install all required modules from the requirements.txt file by running the use of:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The tool has its own conception of what day it is. You can set its date with the use of:
python super.py --set-time 2023-03-20      

If you don't set the date before running any other command, the tool will set an internal date itself. 
It will take the date on which you run the first command.

You can change the tool's internal date of the tool with the use of:
Adding days to the tool's internal date:
python super.py --advance-time 2

Taking days from the tool's internal date:
python super.py --advance-time -2

# ACTIONS

python super.py buy --product-name orange --price 0.8 --expiration-date 2023-04-30
There are no limitations on what products to buy.

To sell a product use:
python super.py sell --product-name orange --price 2
You can only sell products that are currently in inventory. 

# DATE ARGUMENTS
The arguments that will follow in the 'Reports' sections of this guide will all contain a date argument. 
You can freely use a different date argument instead of the ones shown as example. 
The date arguments you can choose from are:
--today     > should NOT be followed by any input
--now       > should NOT be followed by any input
--yesterday > should NOT be followed by any input
--date      > should be followed by a date in format: yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy-m-d, or a period in format: yyyy-mm or yyyy-m 
--period    > should be followed by a period in format: yyyy-mm or yyyy-m

Exception: --period can not be used for 'report' arguments
Take into account that any date argument will be based on the tool's internal date (stored in 'today.csv').
