I want to highlight three technical elements of my implementation:

1)  I created a separate 'helpers.py' file for generic functions (that are not spefically related to the super.py 
    tool) that include code that is needed for a lot of functions. By using these generic functions the amount of code lines inside the super.py file is reduced a lot and it makes it much more easy to read. 

    Code example:
    add_row_to_file(file_path_bought,buy_row,headers_buy)

2)  I chose to check for expired products before and after every command line action. In this way the result of the 
    command line action will always show the correct amount of inventory (since expired products will be left out of the inventory). By placing this function in the 'main' function before and after executing the function that matches the command line argument, we do not have to remember to add this function elsewhere (e.g. for future functions that require an up-to-date inventory). 

    Code example:
    check_expired_products()

3) In the 'main' function I chose to validate for any date argument given in the command line. Since these date 
    arguments could be a string (e.g. '--yesterday'), a date (e.g. 2023-02-01) or a period (e.g. 2023-02), I created a central place to transform these date arguments into dates. In this way we don't have to do any transformations inside the functions. This makes the code inside the functions shorter and the use of the function more flexible.

    Example:
    The command line:
    python super.py report revenue --date 2019-12

    will be transformed to the following code inside 'main':
    get_revenue_report(2019-12-01,2019-12-31)


Furthermore I added 2 additional non-trivial features:
1)  I used the 'Rich' module to highlight the command line output in colors with a positive (green) output or      
    negative (red) output
2)  I created an option to generate a profit chart in Excel. This can be generated by using the 'chart' 
    command line option, e.g.:
    python super.py chart profit --period 2023-02
